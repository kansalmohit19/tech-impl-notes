# Tech Implementation Notes

Welcome to my curated collection of technical implementation notes. This repository contains simplified explanations and from-scratch implementations of commonly used components in software development, including data structures, system design patterns, and algorithmic utilities.

Each entry aims to explain:
- The **problem or concept** it addresses.
- A **custom implementation** (when applicable).
- **Design decisions** and trade-offs.
- **Use cases** in real-world systems.
